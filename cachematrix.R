## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be 
## some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute 
## it repeatedly

## makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the inverse value of the matrix
## 4. get the inverse value of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
